# hello-world
First time using github
I'm pretty new to this whole programming thing, but I've built and implemented
some very basic php web sites before, and I am interested in improving my
knowledge (most particularly by learning go because I find it kind of intriguing
and understand that it is supposed to run faster than many other languages and 
be simpler to learn and implement).
